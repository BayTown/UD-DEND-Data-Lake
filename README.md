## Data Lake
---


## Introduction  
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.  
As their data engineer, I am tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow the analytics team of Sparkify to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.


## Project Description
In this project, I'll apply techniques with Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. I will load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. I'll deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.


## Project Datasets
I'am working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:
- Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
- Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`


### Song Dataset  
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```json
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```  

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Database schema
Here you have an overview of the schemes of the tables:

## ETL pipeline
Here is an illustration of the ETL pipeline:

## How to run the scripts
- First you have to enter your AWS IAM user credentials in the file `dl.cfg`.
- Second, you must set the `OUTPUT_PATH` in the file `dl.cfg`. This path specifies where the parquet files are saved.
- If you have a spark cluster running on AWS EMR, you can run the script as follows:
    ```bash
    pyspark etl.py
    ```


## Explanation of the files in the project  
- `etl.py`
  - This function maps the ETL task in this project. 
- `dwh_example.cfg`
  - Here I have provided an example of the necessary config file. This file contains a few explanations. If this file is filled with credentials, it should not be shared under any circumstances.
- `tools.py`
  - Contains functions which are useful for etl.py, eg. read_config and print_status
